# National Transit Database Data Viewer

This dashboard visualizes the National Transit Database managed by the Federal Transit Administration. Currently, this dataset is not structured in a way to quickly generate analytical tools. This data viewer app takes the National Transit Database and turns it into engaging data to identify trends and understand the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the nation's transit ridership. Data is aggregated by rail and non-rail modes as well as the primary metro area in which the services are operated. This is important as transit agencies receive funding based on the population of their service area. Ideally, a tool like this could be used by policy makers for gather quick statistics about ridership on the nation's transit systems without having to download and analyze the dataset. Such a tool would make the data far more accessible, especially to those without data science skills.

This dashboard was created to demonstrate some of the skills taught in Nathan Zimmerman's CPLN692 OPen Source GIS for the Web at the University of Pennsylvania. Data is for demonstration purproses only and no affiliation to the Federal Transit Administration. This dashboard was designed to demonstrate the following skills:
<br>(1) Structuring a JavaScript based web app with multiple pages
<br>(2) Adding custom elements to the CSS
<br>(3) Use of the chart.js library
<br>(4) Use of interactive UI elements
<br>(5) Loading in additional libarires (Font Awesome)
